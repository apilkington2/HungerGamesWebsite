    <p><img src="graphics_br/katnissindex.jpg" alt="Katniss Everdeen" width="282" height="211" align="right" hspace="5" /><span class="justify">Hunger Games is about a young teenage girl named Katniss  Everdeen, who is sixteen years old. In Panam, they have an annual event called  the Hunger Games. There are 12 Districts in Panam (there was 13 but District 13  was destroyed), and Katniss lives in District 12, where every year everyone in  the community gathers in the town square. All the girls and boys between the  ages of 12 and 18 have their names put in a bowl, and one girl and one boy are  drawn in what is called the reaping. The peoples&rsquo; names that are drawn have to  go to the Hunger Games. The Capital, where all the rich and powerful people  live, design an arena where they take the two kids from each district (24  total) go to fight to the death. The last person left standing is crowned the  victor, and gets to go home to live the rest of their life in luxury. When  District 12 had the reaping this time it was Prim, <img src="graphics_br/katnissindex3.jpg" alt="Katniss Peeta and Effie at the Capital" width="328" height="218" align="left" hspace="5" />Katniss&rsquo;s sisters, first  time having her name in the bowl. With all odds not in their favor, Prim&rsquo;s name  was drawn and the heartbroken Katniss Everdeen volunteered for her. Peeta  Mellark was the boy who was drawn, a kid from Katniss&rsquo;s school who had helped  her a lot when she had no food after her dad&rsquo;s death. Together the two went  into the arena, and started to form a love interest with each other. Soon after  Katniss&rsquo;s ally, Rue, died the Capital announced that if the tributes are from  the same district then they could both win. That means that both Katniss and  Peeta could make it out alive! Katniss found Peeta with a severely injured leg,  and they hideaway in a cave. There they grew closer and closer together.  Katniss felt as if it was all a hoax, but deep down couldn&rsquo;t deny she became  closer to Peeta. They stayed together in the cave, Katniss nursing Peeta back  to life, as more and more tributes died. Clinging to the thought that they have  a chance of both making it back home alive.</span></p>
